<h2>About TOSBack</h2>

<p>
Terms-Of-Service and other website policies form the foundation of your relationship with social networking sites, online businesses, and other Internet communities. But most people become aware of these terms only when there's a problem. TOSBack was created to help you monitor the policies for the websites you use everyday, and show how they change over time.
</p>

<p>
TOSBack is a project of <a href="http://www.eff.org/">The Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. We are a non-profit membership-funded organization. If you like TOSBack, please consider making a <a href="http://secure.eff.org/donate">donation</a> or becoming a <a href="http://www.eff.org/support">member</a>.

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>
Noticed an error? Got a policy you'd like us to track? Email <a href="mailto:tosback@eff.org">tosback@eff.org</a>. 
</p><p>
If you're suggesting a policy, please provide the URL and an explanation of why you think it's important. We only have so many hours in the day, so we can't track every policy on the web, and may not be able to reply to every email. It takes time and work to add a new policy to TOSBack and ensure it's being tracked correctly.

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
While we've tried to accurately convey what the user agreements indexed here said, and when they said it, we can't be sure that we always succeeded. So, before relying on these materials, please confirm with the operator of the website in question.

<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>
TOSBack is powered by PHP/MySQL. The code is open-source &mdash; We'll be posting a tarball of it here shortly. Special thanks to the developers of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpwiki/">PHPWiki</a> and <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, whose <a href="http://drupal.org/project/diff">diff engine</a> was gratefully adapted for use in TOSBack.
