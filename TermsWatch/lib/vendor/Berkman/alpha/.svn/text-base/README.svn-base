This folder contains various projects that were initiated over the summer and are in various states of incompletion. These projects may prove to be useful, or completed, in the future.

BTE_Perl - A Perl implementation of the BTE algorithm. This seems close to done, the code has been converted from Python to Perl, but the Perl implementation currently returns incorrect results.

DomFinder - Perl implementation of an algorithm for finding the DOM element that contains a provided string. This is pretty broken, I had difficulty deciding what assumptions I was willing to accept (does the user provide only text that is in the page?)

Multithread_Crawler - A multithread implementation of the crawler. I believe the script does run though all the policies, however the script itself does not terminate. Also, the script makes no attempt to share variables, this should be improved upon.

TosDetector - An attempt at creating a bayes analysis based detector of TOS language.
