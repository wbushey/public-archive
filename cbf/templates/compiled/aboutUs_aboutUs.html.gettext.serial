We were interns at IBM at the time and living in a quaker boarding school, so you can imagine our frequent and urgent need for after-work beers.";i:1;s:502:"We were sidled up to the bar and I was thinking about the movie "Fight Club", and the conversation between Edward Norton and Brad Pitt about what celebrity they would most like to fight. Norton's answer is "Shatner". Soon Billiam and I were pontificating on whom celebrities would most like to fight, and who would win (Troy thought the game was stupid and didn't want to play). A few beers later, we had a whole list of fights, the bartender was getting into it, as well as some of our fellow patrons.";i:2;s:440:"Fast forward to the present (well, really the near past). Billiam was completing his senior year at university and looking for a project that will help him understand the ins-and-outs of php. I, always full of stupid ideas, talked Bill into helping me build a website based on our bar game. So, while Billiam worked his magic with MySql and php, I came up with plenty of fights, secured a domain name, and the rest, as they say, is history.";i:3;s:62:"If you wish to contact us then please send us an email via our";i:4;s:12:"Contact Page";}
