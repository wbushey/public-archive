### Bill's Notes: Idea - create another config file that is a master config, then use a build process that
### transfers settings from master config to Propel's config files

####### Basic Properties #######
# The name of the project 
propel.project = cbf
 
####### Ant Properties #######
# Root directory of application development
project.home = /home/bill/Development/workspace/cbf

# Directory where build files (including this file) can be found
project.build = ${project.home}/build/dev_machine

# Directory to place the Propel class models
propel.output.dir = ${project.home}/boris

# Directory to place the generated SQL files
propel.sql.dir = ${project.build}/sql

# Directory that contains the schema.xml file
propel.schema.dir = ${project.build}

# Directory that contains the runtime-conf.xml file
propel.conf.dir = ${project.build}

 
# The package name where the model classes will be placed.  The
# package name should be formatted as xxxx.xxxx.xxxx, etc. rather
# than as a directory name.
propel.targetPackage = models
 
####### Database Properties #######
# The database driver 
propel.database = mysql

# URL of the database that the site is to use
propel.database.url = mysql:host=localhost;dbname=cbf

# Username that the site is to use on the database
propel.database.user = cbfUser

# Password that the site is to use on the database
propel.database.password = password!!!
